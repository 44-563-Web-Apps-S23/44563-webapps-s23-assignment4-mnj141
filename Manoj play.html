        MRS. BAUER. No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the
            transmitter._] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause._] I'll tell him
            just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.
            
                 [MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into
                 basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
                 BAUER'S _door and looks in_.

            <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?</p>
            
                 [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._
            
            <h6>LANE.</h6><p>Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
            groceries for Sawyers.</p>
            
            <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6><p>[_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
            which hangs beside the door._] Here.</p>

            <h6>LANE.</h6> <p>About the boss. [MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.] Heard your
